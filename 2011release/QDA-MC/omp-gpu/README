A. Compiling and executing the code

1. The default mode is to compile for a sequential execution and using the standard deviation of the higher order solution for convergence. The CPU GPU transfer is done synchronously.

   To compile in this mode
   
   a. Set the Environment variables OPENCL_INCDIR and OPENCL_LIBDIR to point to the directories which have the OpenCL include file and libraries respectively
   
   b. At command line type
   
   $> make CFLAGS=-DDO_GPU

   To run the code
   
   $> ./qdmc

2. Run-time options:
   The physical properties of the system can be defined from the command line by using the following options:

     --help                display this help and exit
     --version             output version information and exit
     --particles           the number of particles to simulate
     --numcells            the number of discrete simulation cells
     --runwidth            run width for averaging
     --syslength           the length of the system
     --tolerance           end-condition tolerance
     --tolstd              end-condition tolerance (standard deviation)
     --numiters            number of iterations to run if stopping condition is unsatisfied
     --sigs                Scattering cross-section to be used
     --sigt                Total cross-section to be used
     -s                    Minimize the data printed to screen

   

3. To build an asynchronous version of the code compile as follows
   
   $> make CFLAGS=-DDO_ASYNC
