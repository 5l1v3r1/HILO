A. Compiling and executing the code

1. The default mode is to compile for a sequential execution and using the standard deviation of the higher order solution for convergence 

   To compile in this mode at command line type
   
   $> make

   To run the code
   
   $> ./cmc

2. Run-time options:
   The physical properties of the system can be defined from the command line by using the following options:

     --help                display this help and exit
     --version             output version information and exit
     --particles           the number of particles to simulate
     --numcells            the number of discrete simulation cells
     --runwidth            run width for averaging
     --syslength           the length of the system
     --tolerance           end-condition tolerance
     --tolstd              end-condition tolerance (standard deviation)
     --numiters            number of iterations to run if stopping condition is unsatisfied
     --sigs                Scattering cross-section to be used
     --sigt                Total cross-section to be used
     -s                    Minimize the data printed to screen

3. To compare with analytical solutions ( using L2 norm for convergence check )
   
   a. Small Problem size : sig_t = 1.0, sig_s = 0.99 , Number of particles = 10000000, Sys Length = 10.0, number of cells = 100
      
      To compare the CMC solution with analytical solution build using the command

      $> make CFLAGS=-DL2_2
      
      To run the small problem

      $> ./cmc 
   
 
4. To build to use with MPI use the following command 
   
   $> make CC=mpicc CFLAGS=-DDO_MPI
