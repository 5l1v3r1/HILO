A. Compiling and executing the code

1. The default mode is to compile for a sequential execution 

   To compile in this mode at command line type
   
   $> make

   To run the code
   
   $> ./cmc

2. Run-time options:
   The physical properties of the system can be defined from the command line by using the following options:

  --help                display this help and exit
  --version             output version information and exit
  --particles           the number of particles to simulate
  --numcellsx           the number of discrete simulation cells in x direction
  --numcellsy           the number of discrete simulation cells in y direction
  --syslengthx          the length of the system along x direction
  --syslengthy          the length of the system along y direction
  --tolerance           end-condition tolerance
  --tolstd              end-condition tolerance (standard deviation)
  --numiters            number of iterations to run if stopping condition is unsatisfied


3. To build to use with MPI use the following command 
   
   $> make CC=mpicc CFLAGS=-DDO_MPI
